# Dungeon Despair Domain

This repository contains the domain definitions and functions for Large Language Models function calling in OpenAI's-compatible format.

Dungeon Despair is used as:
* A video-game, available [here](https://github.com/gallorob/dungeon-despair)
* A domain for LLMaker, a natural-language based design assistant, available [here](https://github.com/gallorob/llmaker)

## Domain Description
A `Level` in the dungeon is comprised of `Room`s and `Corridor`s. Each `Room` can have a maximum of 4 `Corridor`s (one per cardinal direction). Within a `Room` or a `Corridor` there are `Encounter`s. A `Room` only has a single `Encounter`, whereas a `Corridor` has as many `Encounter`s as its length (in cells).

An `Encounter` can be empty, or can contain one or more of the following entities: `Enemy`, `Trap`, and `Treasure`. A `Trap` can only be found in a `Corridor`, whether the other two entities can be found in either a `Room` or a `Corridor`.

All parameters that define the level can be tweaked in `domain/configs.py`.

Editing the level can be achieved by executing the relevant functions in `functions.py` (or letting an LLM do it for you ðŸ˜‰). `Hero`es are currently not supported for generation.
